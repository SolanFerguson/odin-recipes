	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>Whenever I was with my father in france, we ate this dish nearly every 
	day. While it can be bought at any supermarket there, in Canada it tends 
	to be hard to get ahold of. So to relive nostalgic times I decided to
	seek out a good recipe and make it on my own!</p>
	
	<p>This recipe hits every flavour note you'd want out of it. The addition
	of the real vanilla extract and white chocolate does wonders.
	And on top of all that, it's deceptively easy to make. The biggest hurdle 
	is waiting for it to set before eating. I'd be remiss to not link the
	<a href="https://chefjeanpierre.com/recipes/dessert/creme-caramel/" 
	  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original recipe</a> as
	this is just a personal collection of recipes for web dev practice. 
	Chef Jean Pierre has a lovely video to go along with the recipe, as well 
	as his charisma.</p>
