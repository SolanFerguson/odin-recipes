    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever I was with my father in france, we ate this dish nearly every
      day. While it can be bought at any supermarket there, in Canada it tends
      to be hard to get ahold of. So to relive nostalgic times I decided to seek
      out a good recipe and make it on my own!
    </p>

    <p>
      This recipe hits every flavour note you'd want out of it. The addition of
      the real vanilla extract and white chocolate does wonders. And on top of
      all that, it's deceptively easy to make. The biggest hurdle is waiting for
      it to set before eating. I'd be remiss to not link the

      as this is just a personal collection of recipes for web dev practice.
      Chef Jean Pierre has a lovely video to go along with the recipe, as well
      as his charisma.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>The Caramel</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A &frac12; cup of Sugar</li>
      <li>A &frac14; cup of Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Custard</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Whole Eggs</li>
      <li>
        A &frac12; cup of Sugar, or a &frac14; cup of Sugar and 2 ounces of
        White Chocolate
      </li>
      <li>12 ounces Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
      <li>A pinch of Salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of real Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h4>Preparations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the Oven to 275&deg;F / 135&deg;C.</li>
      <li>
        Coat 4 ramekins (6 to 8 ounces) with a light coating of non-stick spray
        / butter.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making the Caramel</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the sugar and water in a bowl until dissolved. Heat in a saucepan on
        medium to low heat. After around 10 minutes the sugar will begin to
        brown. As soon as it become a dark golden brown colour, take it off the
        heat and carefully add a couple tablespoons of water to stop it from
        darkening further. Be <em>very careful</em> as sugar is likely to spit
        up at you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour carefully in your ramekins, tilting them around to coat evenly .
        Cool in freezer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making the Custard:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, bring the cream and milk to a light boil. Add and mix in
        the sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix the eggs, salt, and vanilla. Do not whisk it
        briskly, don't let air into the mixture. Strain it in order to get the
        smoothest texture. Slowly add the mixture into each of your molds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the molds into a hot water bath, and bake for an hour. Once done
        take them out the oven and remove from bath when cooled enough to do so.
        Let cool at room temp for 3 to 4 hours. Then stick in fridge for 6 to 24
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen the edges of the custards with your index carefully flip onto a
        plate and while holding it firmly give it a vigourous shake to the side
        in order to release from the mold.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
